# Car Sales Analysis â€“ Excel Project

## Overview
This project analyzes car sales data to uncover key trends, performance metrics, and actionable insights. Using **Excel**, I cleaned, processed, and visualized the data to understand sales performance, profitability, and customer preferences.

## Tools Used
- **Microsoft Excel**: For data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.

## Key Metrics and Insights
1. **Total Sales**: Calculated the total sales revenue after discounts.
2. **Total Profit**: Determined the overall profit generated from car sales.
3. **Profit Margin**: Calculated the profit margin for each car model and segment.
4. **Units Sold by Segment**: Analyzed the number of units sold by car segment (e.g., SUV, Sedan).
5. **Sales by Country**: Identified the top-performing countries in terms of sales revenue.
6. **Discount Impact**: Analyzed the impact of discounts on sales and profitability.
7. **Monthly Sales Trends**: Visualized sales trends over time to identify peak sales months.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Removed duplicates and handled missing values.
   - Standardized column formats (e.g., dates, currency).

2. **Data Analysis**:
   - Used Excel formulas and pivot tables to calculate key metrics like total sales, profit, and profit margin.
   - Grouped data by segment, country, and month to identify trends.

3. **Data Visualization**:
   - Created charts and graphs (e.g., bar charts, line graphs) to visualize sales trends, profitability, and segment performance.
   - Used conditional formatting to highlight key insights (e.g., top-performing products, high-profit margins).

## Key Insights
- **Top-Performing Segment**: Identified the most profitable car segment (e.g., SUVs).
- **Discount Strategy**: Discovered that higher discounts did not always lead to higher profits.
- **Seasonal Trends**: Found that sales peaked during specific months (e.g., December).
